    "One of the challenging things about using open source technologies is that it is rarely presented as a \"complete\" software package.  If you're working in Excel, you don't need to go outside of the program to insert a \"square root of the sum of squares\" equation, for example.  It's a function in Excel. With open source software, different functions are created by different programmers, and we often have to \"call\" in that external program to do what we want. These are called libraries.\n",
